## 📌 About the Piscine

The _Piscine_ (French for "swimming pool") is a rigorous 4-week selection program at 42, designed to evaluate programming aptitude and adaptability. Participants are immersed in the C programming language, with daily exercises, weekend rush challenges, and frequent peer evaluations. The process emphasizes self-directed learning, resilience, and collaboration.
