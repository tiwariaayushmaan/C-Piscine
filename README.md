42 Berlin Piscine – C Projects & Rush Challenges
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of all C projects and rush challenges completed during the 42 Berlin Piscine—an intensive, month-long immersion into the fundamentals of low-level programming, algorithmic thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. Each project reflects the learning curve and determination involved in this unique experience.

📌 About the Piscine
The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is a rigorous 4-week selection program at 42, designed to evaluate programming aptitude and adaptability. Participants are immersed in the C programming language, with daily exercises, weekend rush challenges, and frequent peer evaluations. The process emphasizes self-directed learning, resilience, and collaboration.

📂 Project Breakdown
🔹 C Projects
A series of foundational projects aimed at developing proficiency in C programming and system-level concepts:

C_00 – Basics of C syntax, functions, and loops

C_01 – Pointers, arrays, and string manipulation

C_02 – Advanced string handling and standard library recreation

C_03 – Deeper insights into string operations and manual implementation

C_04 – Logic-based challenges to reinforce programming techniques

C_05 – Introductory algorithmic problem-solving and math-focused tasks

C_06 – Handling command-line arguments and input parsing

C_07 – Memory allocation and advanced pointer/string manipulation

C_08 – Introduction to Makefiles and build automation

C_09 – Basic file I/O operations and working with system calls

🔹 Rush Projects
Weekend-long collaborative challenges designed to simulate real-world development under time constraints:

Rush_00 – Print a character-based rectangle using width and height parameters

Rush_01 – Solve a 4x4 visibility puzzle based on constraints from four sides

Rush_02 – Number-to-word conversion using dictionary parsing and memory handling

💡 Key Learnings
Solidified understanding of core C concepts and system-level programming

Enhanced analytical thinking and debugging capabilities

Adapted to high-pressure environments and tight deadlines

Fostered strong collaboration through peer-to-peer evaluation and teamwork

🛠️ Usage Instructions
To explore the projects locally:

bash
