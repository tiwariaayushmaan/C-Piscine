# C-Piscine

A collection of all C projects and rush challenges completed during the 42 Berlin Piscine. This repo showcases my journey through an intense month of low-level programming, problem-solving, and peer learning. Each project reflects my growth, resilience, and passion for coding.

42 Berlin Piscine â€“ C Projects & Rush Challenges ðŸš€
Welcome to my 42 Berlin Piscine repository! This repo contains all the C projects and rush challenges I completed during the intensive month-long Piscine at 42 Berlin. This experience pushed me beyond my limits, refining my problem-solving skills, deepening my understanding of low-level programming, and fostering a strong collaborative mindset.

ðŸ“Œ About the Piscine
The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is a rigorous 4-week selection process at 42, where participants dive deep into C programming, algorithms, and peer-to-peer learning. Itâ€™s an environment that encourages self-learning, resilience, and teamwork, with daily assignments, rush projects, and evaluation sessions.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview
ðŸ”¹ C Projects
These projects focus on mastering C fundamentals, memory management, and algorithmic problem-solving.

C_00 â€“ Introduction to C syntax, functions, and loops
C_01 â€“ Pointers, Strings and Arrays
C_02 â€“ String manipulation and standard library functions
C_03 â€“ String manipulation and re-building string functions
C_04 â€“ Advanced logic-building exercises.
C_05 â€“ Mathematical problems and Algorithms.
C_06 â€“ Command line Arguments.
C_07 â€“ Dynamic Memory Allocation and advanced string manipulation.
C_08 â€“ MakeFiles
C_09 â€“ File Input/Output.
ðŸ”¹ Rush Projects
Rush projects are intensive weekend challenges that test problem-solving, collaboration, and time management.

Rush_00 â€“ Creating a function that prints a rectangle of given width and height using specific characters for the edges and corners.

Rush_01 â€“ Filling 4x4 grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column satisfies visibility constraints from four directions (top, bottom, left and right), where the visibility refers to how many boxes are visible from each direction based on their height.

Rush_02 â€“ Creating a program that converts numbers into their written word representation using a directory while handling file parsing, memory allocation, and large number processing.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
âœ… Mastered core C programming concepts
âœ… Improved problem-solving and debugging skills
âœ… Learned to work under pressure and tight deadlines
âœ… Gained experience in peer-to-peer learning and teamwork
